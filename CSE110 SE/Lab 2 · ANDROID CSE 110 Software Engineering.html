		<h2 id="intro-android">Unit 1: Introduction to Android</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>What is Android?
				<ul>

					<p>
						Android is an operating system offered by Google. It runs in several different devices, such
					as phones, tablets, wearables, automobiles, TVs, etc.
					It uses Java under the hood, with many APIs available. An
					application programming interface (API)
					is a library provided by other developers to facilitate the use of certain generic
					functionalities.
					If you want to learn more about APIs, click
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank">here</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
					Google is constantly releasing updates to Android. The (current) latest version of Android
						is called Android 10. If you want to learn more about Android 10 and its new features, click
					<a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10" target="_blank">here</a>.
					In this lab, you will get a brief introduction to some of the Android features and learn how to build
						a simple mobile app. This lab is NOT a comprehensive tutorial; it is, however, a way to get
						you acquainted with this platform, and hopefully inspire you to many great projects and products.
						Be bold, limitless, and don't be afraid of exploring what Android has to offer.
					</p>

				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Why Android?
				<ul>
					In CSE110, you will have 10 weeks (in reality, ~8 weeks) to develop a working application
						from the ground up, and Android offers a great platform across different devices, a vibrant community,
						and regular updates announced every year during the <a href="https://events.google.com/io" target="_blank">Google I/O event</a>.
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<hr>
		<p>In order to get the In Progress Check, you will need to run the <strong>First Application</strong> successfully
			on the day of the lab during your specific lab reservation time.</p>

		<hr>

		<h2 id="project">Unit 2: Creating a Project</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>In case you have not already done so, please refer to the
				<a href="http://ieng6.ucsd.edu/~cs110x/static/labs/lab2/index2.html" target="_blank"> pre-lab</a>
				on how to download and install Android Studio.
			</li>
			<li>Launch Android Studio to create your first project.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Click on the <strong>Start a new Android Studio project</strong> to get started
						<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image1.png" alt="image1">
					</li>
					<li>
						Next, there will be series of template "Activities" to add to the application.
						Selecting these activities will configure the application for specific tasks,
						such as the <em>Login Activity</em>. For now, select the <strong>Basic Activity</strong> under the <strong>Phones and Tablets</strong> tab,
						then click <strong>Next</strong>.<br>
						NOTE: You can add more activities to your application later.
						<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image2.png" alt="image2">
					</li>
					<li>
						Name the application <strong>FirstApplication</strong>.
						The minimum API level asks for the target devices and minimum SDK for your application to run on.
						The minimum SDK refers to the version
						of Android any device running the application will be required to have in order to run properly.
						For this project select:
						<strong>API 21: Android 5.0 (Lollipop)</strong>,
						and click <strong>Finish</strong>.
						<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image3.png" alt="image3">
					</li>
					<li>
						Android Studio generates all the necessary files to create the application,
						which will load in a window similar the one below in about 1-2 minutes.
						<ul>
							<li>Note: if the project view (left side of the screen) looks different than
							the image below, click the dropdown menu in the upper left (labeled "Android")
							and change the view to match. <br \="">
								Note: if your working area (canvas) looks different, click on the MainActivity.java tab located
								above the working area.
							</li>
							<li>If the MainActivity.java tab is not there, navigate as follows: <br \="">
								<p>Select <strong>Project</strong> on the project view dropdown, then go to
								<code>FirstApplication -&gt; app -&gt; src -&gt; main -&gt;
								java -&gt; com.mycompany.firstapplication -&gt; MainActivity.java</code></p>
								<p>OR</p>
								<p>Select <strong>Android</strong> on the project view dropdown, then go to
								<code>app -&gt;
									java -&gt; com.mycompany.firstapplication -&gt; MainActivity </code></p>
							</li>
							<li>NOTE: If you are having issues with Gradle, please click <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin.html#updating-plugin" target="_blank">here</a> for help.</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image4.png" alt="image4">
					</li>
					<li>
						Now open the Main Activity on left sidebar, and rename the <strong>MainActivity</strong> to <strong>HelloWorld</strong>. Do this by right clicking the Main Activity, going to refactor, and then rename.
						<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image5.png" alt="image5">
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="android-vm">Unit 3: Creating an Android Virtual Machine</h2>
		<ul>
			<p>
				Now, we will create an Android emulator to run our <strong>First Application</strong>.
				Emulators help test certain aspects of your application in different devices with relative ease.
				Keep in mind, though, that the
				<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html" target="_blank">emulator</a> does not
				replace a real device, and it does NOT contain
				virtual hardware for some features such as Bluetooth, NFC, or Wi-Fi (&lt; API 25).
				For this lab, the emulator will work just fine.
				<br>
				NOTE: In general, it is preferred to test your Android apps using a real device instead of the emulator.
			</p>
			<li>
				To get started, right click on your working area and click on <strong>Run 'app'</strong>
				. Alternatively, you can also click on the green <em>Play</em> button.
				<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image6.png" alt="image6">
			</li>
			<li>
				You will now be prompted to select a device or an emulator. Click on <strong>Create New Virtual Device</strong>
				 to add a new emulator.
				<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image7.png" alt="image7">
			</li>
			<li>
				On the next screen, select <strong>Phone</strong> as the category, then select a device.
				 Keep in mind that newer devices usually require more disk space. Click <strong>Next</strong>.
				<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image8.png" alt="image8">
			</li>
			<li>
				Now, download and select <strong>Pie (API 28)</strong> as the image to load onto the emulator. Click <strong>Next</strong>.
				<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image9.png" alt="image9">
			</li>
			<li>
				Finally, you will be able to review your selections. Click <strong>Finish</strong> when done.
				<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image10.png" alt="image10">
			</li>
			<li>
				You will, then, be brought back to select a device or an emulator. Your newly created emulator will be listed.
				 Simply choose the emulator, and click <strong>OK</strong>.
				<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image11.png" alt="image11">
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If everything goes OK, the emulator will appear in a new window and load your app automatically.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you get a message that SystemUI has stopped working, choose the option to wait. Do not close the application.</li>
					<li>If you aren't taken directly to your app, "swipe" (drag your 
mouse) up on the Android home screen and select your FirstApplication app from
 the apps drawer that comes up.</li>	
				</ul>
				
				<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Linux and Windows users <em>might</em> have some hardware acceleration issues.
					If so, please click <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration.html" target="_blank">here</a>
					for help or check with a tutor.
				</p>
				<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image12.png" alt="image12">
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="check-point"><strong>In Progress Check</strong></h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				When you are able to run the <strong>First Application</strong> application on the emulator or your phone
				, please follow these instructions:
			</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Add a ticket to the Autograder with one tag for the priority of your ticket and another with <i>In Progress Check</i> status;</li>
				<li>Display your lab reservation time on cse110.com for verification. <u>Select your lab reservation time correctly</u>;</li>
				<li>Display your completed <strong>First Application</strong> on the emulator or your phone.</li>
			</ul>

			<li>
				A staff member will verify the above and give you an <i>In Progress Check</i>.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<hr>

		<h2 id="calculator">Unit 4: Calculator Application</h2>

		Now, you will create a second application that does a little more than just printing "Hello World!"

		<h3 id="calc-start">4.1: Getting Started</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				To get started, create a new project by going to <strong>File -&gt; New -&gt; New Project</strong>.
			</li>
			<li>
				select the <strong>Basic Activity</strong> under the <strong>Phones and Tablets</strong> tab, then click <strong>Next</strong>.<br>
				<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image13.png" alt="image13">
			</li>
			<li>
				Name the project <strong>Simple Calculator</strong>, and choose the <strong>API 21</strong> from the Minimum API Level menu and click <strong>Finish</strong>.
				<ul>
					<li>This option allows you to pick what versions of Android OS your application will support.
					API 21 supports about 85% of Android users, and still has some newer features.
						<strong>API 29</strong> is the current version (Android 10). For the purpose of this lab, leave all other settings as default.
					</li>
					<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image14.png" alt="image14">
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Now we need a more complete view of an Android project. If you do NOT have a project view, select
				 <strong>Project</strong> on the upper left corner to show a tree of your project. Then, above
				the <strong>app</strong> tree, there is a drop down menu with Android selected by default. Select
				<strong>Project</strong> to change to project view.
				<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image15.png" alt="image15">
			</li>
			<li>
				Now open
				<strong>SimpleCalculator -&gt; app -&gt; src -&gt; main -&gt; java -&gt; (package name) -&gt; MainActivity
						</strong> from the panel on the left side of the IDE.
				<ul>
					<li>
						This is your activity's main class, which is very similar to Java's main. When the application is run, this is
					the code that starts your app.
						<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image16.png" alt="image16">
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The next few bullets will demonstrate how Android controls its visual layer, or View.
				<ul>
					<li>From the left side panel open <strong>res -&gt; layout</strong>.
						<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image17.png" alt="image17">
					</li>
					<li>Under the <em>layout</em> subdirectory you will see two files: <strong>activity_main.xml</strong> and <strong>content_main.xml</strong>.
						 These two files control the default layout for your activity. <strong>activity_main.xml</strong> contains the
						starter code for your application, and, at the bottom, links in the <strong>content_main.xml</strong>. <strong>content_main.xml</strong> is
						where we will be adding content to update how our application looks.
				</li></ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				First, remove some irrelevant code from <strong>activity_main.xml</strong>. Double click to open the <strong>activity_main.xml</strong>
				. You should something similar to the screen below.
				<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image18.png" alt="image18">
			</li>
			<li>
				Click on the <strong>Text</strong> tab at the bottom of the screen (in the bottom-left of the working area), next to the <strong>Design</strong> tab.
				Now, delete the <strong>FloatingActionButton</strong> as seen in the highlighted code in the image below.
				This will remove the extra email button that can be seen in the above image.
				<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image19.png" alt="image19">
				<ul>
					<li>In Android Studio you can edit .xml or design code in either design mode or text mode.
						Text mode is more powerful in the sense that it gives you the full power of xml,
						but design allows for a drag and drop interface which is convenient for simple tasks.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Now, open <strong>content_main.xml</strong>. By default, the layout has been set to a <strong>Constraint
				Layout</strong>, which allows you to position items relative to other items on the screen and work with
				dimension constraints. Change that to <strong>Linear Layout</strong> which
				stacks elements linearly. This will be simpler to write for our application purpose. The steps to change to <strong>Linear Layout</strong> follow:
				<ul>
					<li>Currently your <strong>content_main.xml</strong> looks like the image below.
					Change the <strong>ConstraintLayout</strong>
					to <strong>LinearLayout</strong>. In order to do so, replace the <strong>android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout</strong> with <strong>LinearLayout</strong>.
						<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image20.png" alt="image20">
				</li>
					<li>Once you make the changes in the opening (and closing) tags, click back to the <strong>Design</strong> tab.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Now look for a vertically-oriented <strong>Component Tree</strong> text. Clicking on that expands a view that outlines
				all the elements currently in your <strong>content_main.xml</strong>.
				<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image21.png" alt="image21">
				<ul>
					<li>When you select a component in the tree it will highlight it on the virtual phone.
						Use this to delete the <strong>TextView</strong>
					containing <strong>Hello World</strong>
						<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image22.png" alt="image22">
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="calc-design">4.2: Designing the App</h3>

			Now you will use the Design mode to create the layout of your calculator!
			<strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> Make sure you are using the latest version of Android Studio.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Start by clicking the LinearLayout in the ComponentTree. Then find the <strong>background</strong> attribute under the <em>Attributes</em> section on the right hand side (you might need to click "View all attributes" to find the background attribute).
						Click the <strong>...</strong> to open a new window with some colors. Pick a pre-existing color or
						add a new color resource - in this case, a new color value. Select the background color for your calculator. <br \="">
						(If you like the one on the screenshot, use FF8FA7B5)
							<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image23.png" alt="image23"></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Now, you will display the application's title. On the left hand palette, select <strong>TextView</strong>,
						and drag it onto the phone screen.
						<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image24.png" alt="image24">
					</li>
					<li>
						When you drag the TextView, you probably noticed that there is only one place you can put the item on the screen.
						This is because you are using a <strong>Linear Layout</strong>, which either stacks items horizontally or vertically.
					</li>
					<li>
						Now, double click on the TextView to change the displayed text. Change it to <strong>Simple Calculator</strong>.
						The <em>ID</em> attribute is the name of the element. This is used to identify the <strong>TextView</strong> inside the
						application itself. Change the ID to <strong>title</strong>.
						<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image25.png" alt="image25">
					</li>
					<li>Now, center the text:
						<ul>
							<li><p>First, change the <strong>layout_width</strong> attribute to <strong>match_parent</strong>.
								This will cause the text element's width to match the parent, which in this case is the <strong>LinearLayout</strong>.
								The TextView will span the entire screen. Ignore any warnings you get.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Now that the element spans the entire horizontal space you need to center it inside the space.
								Under <strong>Attributes</strong>, scroll down to <strong>gravity</strong> (you might need to click "View all attributes"), click on the empty
								drop down, and select <strong>center_horizontal</strong>.
							</li>
							<p>NOTE: as you navigate through attributes, you can add favorites for easier access. The ones used
							here were condensed in the image below:</p>
							<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image26.png" alt="image26">
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Next, add two fields for the number inputs:
						<ul>
							<li><p>First, you will have the LinearLayout with elements stacking vertically. To do this, click on the <strong>LinearLayout
								</strong> inside the <em>Component Tree</em> and change the orientation field inside <em>Attributes</em>
								to <strong>vertical</strong>.
								<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image27.png" alt="image27"></p>
							</li>
							<li>Next add two <strong>Plain Text</strong> elements from the <strong>Text</strong> fields area under the left hand toolbar.
								The screen should look like the one below when done. If not, make sure that your TextView is resized to fit the text.
								<ul>
									<li>
										You might need to set the <strong>layout_weight</strong> attribute to 0 to ensure all components are displayed. Repeat this step for any other mis-aligned components in the lab.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Edit the ID and text attributes of both new <strong>editText</strong> and <strong>editText2</strong> to read <strong>input1</strong> and
								<strong>input2</strong>. You can also add commonly used strings to <strong>strings.xml</strong>,
								and use them as a <strong>hint</strong> to the user. You may use strings.xml, or simply remove "Name" from the <strong>text</strong> field, and add "Enter a number #1" and "Enter a number #2" in the <strong>hint</strong> field for each input.

								<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image28.png" alt="image28">
							</li>
							
							<li>Finally, set the input type so that the inputs entered in by the user are only decimal.
								<ul>
									<li>Go to <strong>Attributes -&gt; InputType -&gt; numberDecimal</strong> and check this option, and deselect any other options. This will
									restrict users to only inputting numbers, and the app will display the number pad when an input is clicked.<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image28.png" alt="image28">
										<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image29.png" alt="image29">
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>Next, add the basic math buttons:
						<ul>
							<li><p>Insert a <strong>LinearLayout Horizontal</strong> below the 2 inputs. You might need to set the <strong>layout_weight attribute to 0</strong> to ensure all components are displayed. Next drag 5 <strong>Button</strong> items
								into the new <strong>LinearLayout</strong> and the result should look like the below image.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Name the buttons you created. For Text field of <strong>Button</strong> enter <strong>+</strong> and for
								<strong>Id</strong> field enter <strong>plus</strong> for <strong>Button2</strong> enter <strong>-</strong> and
								<strong>minus</strong> for Text and Id fields respectively. For <strong>Button3</strong> enter <strong>*</strong> and
								<strong>multiply</strong> for Text and Id fields respectively. For <strong>Button4</strong> enter <strong>/</strong> and
								<strong>divide</strong> for Text and Id fields respectively and for <strong>Button5</strong> enter <strong>CLR</strong> and
								<strong>clear</strong> for Text and Id fields respectively.
							</li>
							<li>See if you can figure out how to center the buttons. To give you a hint, it is a property of the parent's layout.</li>
							<li>Finally make sure your <strong>Horizontal LinearLayout's</strong> <em>layout_width</em> and <em>layout_height</em> 
								fields are set to <em>match_parent</em>.
								<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image30.png" alt="image30">
							</li>

							<li><strong>NOTE</strong>: you can drag an object between the linear layouts by clicking and holding the object.</li>

						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Lastly, you need to add space to display the final results:
						<ul>
							<li>Add a <strong>LinearLayout Vertical</strong> below <strong>LinearLayout Horizontal</strong>. You might need to reduce the height of this LinearLayout to ensure all components are displayed - ensure the <strong>layout_weight</strong> attribute is set to 0. Next,
							add two <strong>TextView</strong> items inside your newly created LinearLayout. Make sure that for the <strong>LinearLayout</strong> that you just
							added, <strong>layout_width and layout_height</strong> matches the parent. The result should look like the image below.
							</li>

		<h3 id="calc-logic">4.3: Adding the Logic</h3>
			<ul>

			<li>Open <strong>MainActivity</strong> to link the functionality of the calculator to the simple design you implemented above.

				</li><li>Start by deleting the highlighted code shown below. This code implements the <strong>FloatingActionButton</strong>
					you deleted from your <strong>activity_main.xml</strong>.
					<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image32.png" alt="image32">
				</li>
				<li>When you generated your blank activity, Android Studio created a lot of starter code for you. One of these methods
					is <strong>onCreate</strong> method; this method is called when the activity or application starts up. This is
					what links your Design code or <strong>View</strong> from your functional code or <strong>Controller</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>This process starts with the line <code>setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);</code><br>This will link the application's
						<strong>MainActivity</strong> to the application's <strong>activity_main</strong> and <strong>content_main</strong>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Most mobile app development follows the <strong>Model-View-Controller (MVC)</strong> architecture pattern or the 
							<strong>Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)</strong> architecture pattern. You can read more about them 
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">here</a> 
							and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel" target="_blank">here</a>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Create the following fields above the <strong>onCreate</strong> method. These fields are the instances of the objects that
					help you to control your application's layout.<br>
					<code>private EditText operand1;</code><br>
					<code>private EditText operand2;</code><br>
					<code>private Button btnAddition;</code><br>
					<code>private Button btnSubtraction;</code><br>
					<code>private Button btnDivision;</code><br>
					<code>private Button btnMultiplication;</code><br>
					<code>private TextView txtResult;</code><br>
					<code>private Button btnClear;</code><br>
					<p>If there are any errors like the one below, you can click on the line where error is occurring and use <strong>
						alt+ctrl (option + enter on Mac)</strong> to import the necessary library for any of the objects you created.
						<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image33.png" alt="image33">
					</p>

				</li>
				<li>Under <strong>setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);</strong> add the following lines of code. Each of these
					lines will link an element from the <strong>content_main.xml</strong> to one of the fields that you just created above. This is
					achieved by using the <strong>findViewById()</strong> function which you can use to look up ids you assigned inside
					<strong>content_main.xml</strong><br>
					<code>operand1 = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.input1);</code><br>
					<code>operand2 = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.input2);</code><br>
					<code>btnAddition = (Button) findViewById(R.id.plus);</code><br>
					<code>btnSubtraction = (Button) findViewById(R.id.minus);</code><br>
					<code>btnDivision = (Button) findViewById(R.id.divide);</code><br>
					<code>btnMultiplication = (Button) findViewById(R.id.multiply);</code><br>
					<code>txtResult = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.result);</code><br>
					<code>btnClear = (Button) findViewById(R.id.clear);</code>
					<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image34.png" alt="image34">
					If there are any issues, make sure your components' ID fields are what you expect them to be.
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Now, you need to set up listeners for the buttons you created for the <strong>View</strong> of your application. Listeners
					will take actions from users and connect the requests to the controller of your application, so the application can
					perform the requested function. For this application you will use simple <strong>onClickListeners</strong>. They detect
					when one of the buttons is clicked by the user. Android has a variety of built in listeners for things such as swipes,
					taps, and more. The "listener" or "observer" pattern is the most common strategy for creating asynchronous callbacks
					within Android development. Listeners are used for any type of asynchronous event in order to implement the code to
					run when an event occurs. You could read more about listeners
					<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/ui-events.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>You need to setup the <strong>setOnClicker</strong> like shown below. <strong>setOnClickListener</strong>
						is a method of the <strong>Button</strong> object in Android. This generates a new View and Override its
						<strong>onClick</strong> method.
				</li>
				<li>When the button is clicked, the code inside <strong>onClick</strong> is run which, in this case, takes the input
					the user has placed in both <strong>input1</strong> and <strong>input2</strong> TextViews and stores them as doubles.
					The addition operation is performed, and the <strong>result</strong> TextView is updated to display the results
					to the user. Otherwise, if the inputs are not valid, a popup prompting the user to enter a valid input is displayed.
				</li>
				Place the following code at the bottom of the <strong>onCreate()</strong> method.
				<pre><code>btnAddition.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){
	@Override
	public void onClick(View v){
		if ((operand1.getText().length() &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (operand2.getText().length() &gt; 0 )){
			double oper1 = Double.parseDouble(operand1.getText().toString());
			double oper2 = Double.parseDouble(operand2.getText().toString());
			double theResult = oper1 + oper2;
			txtResult.setText(Double.toString(theResult));
		}
		else{
			Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Please enter number in both operand fields", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
		}
	}
});
				</code></pre>
				<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image35.png" alt="image35">


				<li>
					Now implement the subtraction, multiplication, and division functionalities of your application following similar
					process as addition that you followed above. Ensure to name each <strong>btn</strong> according to its functionality.
					For example for division the button is called <strong>btnDivision</strong>.
					<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The code is intentionally repetitive. Feel free to come up with a DRY (don't repeat yourself) solution yourself.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					At last, you need to setup the clear button which will reset the inputs and the result display. Add the following
					code after your button code that you added in the <strong>onCreate()</strong> method.
					<pre><code>
btnClear.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener(){
	@Override
	public void onClick(View v){
		operand1.setText("");
		operand2.setText("");
		txtResult.setText("(result will appear here)");
		operand1.requestFocus();
	}
});
					</code></pre>
				</li>
				<li>Now test your application. In the upper right hand corner click on the play button.
					<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image36.png" alt="image36">
						<ul>
							<li>A window like the one below will pop up. Choose <strong>Launch emulator</strong> and click
							<strong>OK</strong> to open your Android VM or load your Android device.
								<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image37.png" alt="image37">
							</li>
							<li>If there is no emulator found, use the <strong>Create Virtual Device</strong> button to create one. Use all of the default settings.
							</li>
							<li>Once the emulator is launched (this may take a while), you should see something similar to the following.
								<img src="./Lab 2 · CSE 110 Software Engineering_files/l2-image38.png" alt="image38">

							<li>If you aren't taken directly to your app, "swipe" (drag your 
mouse) up on the Android home screen and select your Calculator app from
 the apps drawer that comes up.
							</li>
						</ul>
				</li><li>Great job! You have built a simple, but functional app in Android.
					This might be a great start to more interesting adventures for you.</li>
