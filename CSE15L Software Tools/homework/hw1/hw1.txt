0.  Don't forget to change the file header! (0 points)

1.  `vimtutor` is a helpful tool available with every installation of Vim for
    getting started on the arts of Vim.

    Knowing that `vimtutor` is a program that shows you how to use Vim, what is
    the full command that tells you about the details on how you can use `vimtutor`?
    (1 point)

    [$ man vimtutor]

2.  The command from Question 1 should come with an interesting fact that you
    can launch `vimtutor` in different languages, if you specify that language by
    passing in its two-letter name.

    Knowing that `/usr/share/vim/vim74/tutor` contains all files used by
    `vimtutor`, including the text files of the entire content in all languages
    supported by vimtutor, what is a command that shows you the content of that
    directory, so you can see what languages `vimtutor` supports?  (1 point)

    [$ ls]

3.  For some unknown reason, you feel the urge to translate `vimtutor` into pig
    Latin.  Since you won't have the permission to modify the files inside
    `/usr/share/vim/vim74/tutor`, you will need to create a copy of the English
    tutor file within your own directory.

    What is one single command that will copy the English tutor file
    (`/usr/share/vim/vim74/tutor/tutor`) under your home directory with a new
    file name `tutor.piglatin`?

    Note: /usr/share/vim/vim74/tutor/tutor may not be in the home directory.
    (1 point)

    [$ cp tutor ~///tutor.piglatin]

4.  Even though you barely started to translate the tutorial you will be using
    to teach yourself to use Vim, you still decided to use Vim to conduct the
    translation. In the midst of your work, you accidentally managed to
    delete an entire line under your cursor.

    a) What is a command that could have caused this accident? (1 point)

    [dd]


    b) Give a single command to undo this mistake. (1 point)

    [u]

5.  Give a single command to undo this mistake. (1 point)

    [u]

6.  Assume that you have successfully finished your pig-Latin translation of
    `vimtutor`. Now it's time to teach yourself to use Vim! And the first thing
    you want to learn is how to perform searches in Vim so you can jump to the
    section where it teaches you how to perform searches in Vim.

    What is the Vim command to use to search for the word earchsay ?
    Note: Do not include the quesiton mark in the seach. (1 point)

    [/earchsay]

7.  You suddenly noticed that the `vimtutor` files in all other languages
    follow the same naming convention that ends with the language's two-letter
    name, and you want to follow that same convention.

    What is the command to rename `tutor.piglatin` to `tutor.pg`
    in the current directory? (1 point)

    [mv tutor.piglatin tutor.pg]

8.  List a Vim command that you learned from `vimtutor` which follows each
    requirement below, and in one sentence, describe what the command does:

    a. A single-letter command (1 point)
    b. A CTRL-prefix command (1 point)
    c. A colon command (commands that follow a :) (1 point)

    a. [i : inserts text]
    b. [CTRL-G : shows your location in the file and the file status]
    c. [:wq <ENTER> : saves the file and exits Vim ]


TURNIN PROCEDURE:

    Inside your `hw1` directory, type in `turnin` and follow the instructions.
    Make sure that you get the confirmation email from Autograder.
