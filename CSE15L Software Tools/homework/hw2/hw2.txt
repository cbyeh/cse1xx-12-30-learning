0.  Don't forget to change the file header! (0 point)

1.  You're taking CSE 12 and the PA is due in 25 minutes, but when you run your
    executable with command: `./cse15`, but you get an error message.

    Which file descriptor should the message be printed with?

    [stderr]


2.  What is the command that shows you the full path of your current working
    directory? (1 point)

    [pwd]


3.  cse15.c

     ```
     1 #include <stdio.h>
     2
     3 int my_abs(int  a) {
     4     if (-a < 0) {
     5         a = -a;
     6     }
     7
     8     return a;
     9 }
    10
    11 int main() {
    12     int input = 0;
    13     int output = 0;
    14
    15     input = -17;
    16     output = my_abs(input);
    17
    18     printf("expected: %d\n", 17);
    19     printf("output: %d\n", output);
    20 }
    ```

    What is the command to debug `cse15.c` using GDB, assuming that the
    corresponding executable is named `cse15`? (1 point)

    [gdb cse15]


4.  How do you place a breakpoint at function `main`? (1 point)

    [break main]


5.  At some point during debugging, you see the following being printed after
    you typed in "next":

    15     input = -17;

    What will be printed if you enter "print input?" (1 point)

    [$1 = -17]


6.  What line will be executed when you type "next"? (1 point)

    [16	    output = my_abs(input);]


7.  Say you are on this line:

    16     output = my_abs(input);

    What is a command in GDB that brings your debugging INTO 'my_abs()' and
    executes the first line? (1 point)

    [step]


8.  Now quit GDB.
    After you have fixed the bug in your code, you want to save the output
    printed by your program in order to compare with a reference solution.

    What would you enter in your bash terminal to redirect the output of
    `./cse15` to a file named "my_solution.txt"? (1 point)

    [gcc cse15 > my_solution.txt]


9.  Assume that you have a reference solution file named "ref_solution" that
    containis the expected output of this PA.

    What is the command to help you check whether the `my_solution` and
    `ref_solution` are the same or not? (1 point)

    [vimdiff my_solution ref_solution]


10. Your solution looks perfect. Good job! Now, you are worried your program may
    have memory violations, so there are still more things to check.

    What is a complete command that can help you check for memory issues such
    as memory leaks and invalid memory accesses in your `cse15` executable?
    HINT: The command is not simply `make valgrind`! (1 point)

    [valgrind --leak-check=yes ./cse15]


TURNIN PROCEDURE:

    Inside your `hw2` directory, type in `turnin` and follow the instructions.
    Make sure that you get the confirmation email from Autograder.
