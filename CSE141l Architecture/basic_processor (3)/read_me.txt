Unfortunately none of the programs run, but the files compile.

To compile in quartus, set everything to its default value in New Project Wizard, name the project `TopLevel` and all the .sv files along with `machine_code.txt` and set Simulation to `Active-HDL` and format for `Verilog HDL`. Then start compilation.
